# 👋 Hi, I'm definitely doing my best

Welcome to my profile, where the code is questionable  
and the commit messages are basically cries for help.

- 🧠 I know what I'm doing (occasionally)
- 🛠️ I break things so you don’t have to
- 🐛 Bugs? I call them “unexpected features”
- 🚀 Productivity level: depends on coffee

If any of my repos work, that’s not a bug — that’s a miracle.
